I was inspired by the twitter thread of Mike Morrison and wanted to apply the #betterposter concept to the reproducible (yet simple to use) functionality of the {posterdown} package [@R-posterdown]. If you’re not an R user don’t sweat as you do NOT need to use it at all! Feel free to use only the Markdown functionality of this package :)\r\nObjectives\r\nPick a template layout.\r\nWrite/ create your poster content distraction free.\r\nLet posterdown do its thing!\r\nMethods\r\nI will show here how to include poster elements that may be useful, such as an equation using mathjax:\r\n\\[\r\nE = mc^2\r\n\\]\r\nTo reference a citation you can add your .bib file to the working directory and name it in the YAML metadata or generate an automated one as done here, then you only need to reference the label value in the .bib file. For example this package is built on top of the wonderful {pagedown} package and I will cite it at the end of this sentance using this in the rmd [@R-pagedown] [@R-pagedown].\r\nTo get a better understanding of how to include features like these please refer to the {posterdown} wiki.\r\nNow on to the results!\r\nResults\r\nHere you may have some figures to show off, bellow I have made a scatterplot with the infamous Iris dataset and I can even reference to the figure automatically like this, Figure \\@ref(fig:irisfigure), Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Here is a caption for the figure. This can be added by using the “fig.cap” option in the r code chunk options, see this link from the legend himself, Yihui Xie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe you want to show off some of that fancy code you spent so much time on to make that figure, well you can do that too! Just use the echo=TRUE option in the r code chunk options, Figure 2!\r\n\r\n\r\n#trim whitespace\r\npar(mar=c(2,2,0,0))\r\n#plot boxplots\r\nboxplot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Species,\r\n        col = \"#008080\", \r\n        border = \"#0b4545\",\r\n        ylab = \"Sepal Width (cm)\",\r\n        xlab = \"Species\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Boxplots, so hot right now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow about a neat table of data? See, Table 1:\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: A table made with the knitr::kable function.\r\n\r\n\r\nSepal  Length\r\n\r\n\r\nSepal  Width\r\n\r\n\r\nPetal  Length\r\n\r\n\r\nPetal  Width\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies\r\n\r\n\r\n5.1\r\n\r\n\r\n3.5\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4\r\n\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n4.9\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4\r\n\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n4.7\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3\r\n\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n4.6\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1\r\n\r\n\r\n1.5\r\n\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n5.0\r\n\r\n\r\n3.6\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4\r\n\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n5.4\r\n\r\n\r\n3.9\r\n\r\n\r\n1.7\r\n\r\n\r\n0.4\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n4.6\r\n\r\n\r\n3.4\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4\r\n\r\n\r\n0.3\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n5.0\r\n\r\n\r\n3.4\r\n\r\n\r\n1.5\r\n\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n4.4\r\n\r\n\r\n2.9\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4\r\n\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n4.9\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1\r\n\r\n\r\n1.5\r\n\r\n\r\n0.1\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n5.4\r\n\r\n\r\n3.7\r\n\r\n\r\n1.5\r\n\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n4.8\r\n\r\n\r\n3.4\r\n\r\n\r\n1.6\r\n\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n4.8\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4\r\n\r\n\r\n0.1\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n4.3\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1\r\n\r\n\r\n0.1\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\n5.8\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nsetosa\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Insights from spatial and temporal movements drive many human and ecological studies. These studies enable in-depth analysis and understanding of complex processes like human migration, forest fires and natural disasters as well as mobility and transportation.\r\nA person’s life and consumption path can provide abundant information for us. As GPS data are becoming increasingly prevalent as locational information in movement studies, we can identify the most probable route from a set of GPS pedestrian trajectories and consumption information. We can further demonstrate the relationship between uncertainty in individual GPS measurements at different scales and how these affect the fine-scale movement descriptions.\r\n2. Problems Introduction\r\nIdentify the complex relationships among all of these people and organizations.\r\nIdentify anomalies and suspicious behaviors.\r\nIdentify which people use which credit and loyalty cards.\r\n3. Related Work\r\nTry to figure out the tracks of all the employees based on the GPS tracking of cars and loyalty cards, and then compare the GPS track with the location of celebration. Map the tracks of employee in the map provided, and the map will show the tracks and locations of consumption dynamically. At the same time, by using the unique loyalty number, unique card number and tracks we can identify which people use which credit and loyalty cards.\r\nPlot the consumption of employees, and then find out the suspicious behaviors, like extremely high consumption, repeated consumption in some special locations or make some consumptions nearby the location of celebration on the date of celebration.\r\nMake the employees’ relationship net based on the GPS information. We may see some people will have similar tracks in some dates, and then we can get that they will have more intimate relationships. If a person appears in one location repeatedly, he or she may have potential relationship with this organization.\r\n4. Approach\r\nUse R to clean and tidy data: clean missing values and combine some dataset for further analysis. The package of R used will be tidyr and dplyr.\r\nVisualisation: two kinds of graphs will be plotted. The first one is path diagram which is aim to plot the living and working track of each employee. The another one is relationship net graph. According to these two graphs we will summarize special information for readers.\r\nR shiny: make an application that can see the current employment information, GPS tracks, consumption information and relationship net of each employee. In this application, any suspicious behaviors or special locations will be highlighted.\r\nText analysis: By using the dataset from other challenges, we will analyze the resumes of employees in Challenge 1.\r\nBuild the GitHub Link and Website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
